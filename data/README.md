# Dataset Instructions

This project uses the **Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW)** dataset.

Due to ethical and privacy considerations, face images are not included in this repository.

## Download Instructions
1. Download the LFW dataset from the official source:
   https://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/

2. Extract the dataset locally.

3. Select a subset of identities (10–15 individuals).

4. Organize images into the following structure:

data/
 ├── enrollment/
 └── test/

This ensures reproducibility without redistributing biometric data.
